# Plan: [Epic Title]

<!--
  WEAVE PLAN TEMPLATE — Guidance for documentation & research plans

  This template structures work so `wv plan` can import it into the Weave graph.
  Each ### Sprint section becomes an epic; numbered items become linked tasks.

  IMPORT:  wv plan <this-file.md> --sprint=N [--gh] [--dry-run]
  DRY RUN: Always run --dry-run first to preview what will be created.
  GH SYNC: Use --gh to create GitHub issues for the epic and every task.

  WRITING GUIDANCE:
  1. Start with Context — what problem are we solving and why now?
  2. Define Done — what does success look like? Be specific and testable.
  3. Research first — list unknowns and questions before committing to tasks.
  4. Tasks should be atomic — each completable in one focused session (~2-4 hours).
  5. Order tasks by dependency — earlier items should unblock later ones.
  6. Capture constraints — what's out of scope? What are the non-goals?
  7. One sprint = one theme — don't mix unrelated concerns.
  8. Max 6-8 tasks per sprint — more than that signals need to decompose further.

  TASK FORMAT (for wv plan parsing):
  - Use numbered lists: "1. Task description"
  - Bold alias prefix: "1. **build-release** — copies shipping manifest"
    The bold word becomes the node alias (wv show build-release).
  - Metadata tags in parentheses at end of line:
    "1. **my-task** — description (priority: 1) (after: other-task)"
    Supported tags: (priority: N), (after: alias), (status: done)
  - Mark done items with [x]: "1. [x] Already completed task"
    Equivalent to (status: done).
  - Avoid sub-bullets under numbered items (only top-level items become nodes)
  - Continuation lines: indent 3+ spaces to append to previous task text
  DOCUMENTATION/RESEARCH TASKS — when a task is research or docs, be specific:
  - BAD:  "Research packaging options"
  - GOOD: "Evaluate pip vs pipx vs brew for distribution — write comparison in docs/"
  - BAD:  "Write documentation"
  - GOOD: "Write README for public repo — install, init, workflow, MCP setup sections"

  VERIFICATION — each sprint should end with a verification section:
  - What tests confirm the work is correct?
  - What manual checks should be performed?
  - What does "ready for next sprint" mean?

**Status:** Not Started
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Goal:** [One sentence describing the desired outcome]

## Context

[What problem are we solving? Why now? What prior work exists?]

## Research / Open Questions

- [ ] [Question 1 — what do we need to learn before committing to an approach?]
- [ ] [Question 2]

## Constraints & Non-Goals

- [What's explicitly out of scope?]
- [What constraints must we work within?]

### Sprint N: [Sprint Title]

1. **[alias]** -- [Description of what this task produces. Be specific about
   inputs, outputs, and acceptance criteria.]

2. **[alias]** -- [Description] (after: [alias-of-task-1])

3. **[alias]** -- [Description] (priority: 1)

**Verification:**
- [ ] [How do we know this sprint is done?]
- [ ] [What tests/checks confirm correctness?]

---

### Sprint N+1: [Next Sprint Title]

1. **[alias]** -- [Description] (after: [alias-from-previous-sprint])

2. **[alias]** -- [Description]

**Verification:**
- [ ] [Acceptance criteria for this sprint]
